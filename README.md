# OpenWeatherGO

A GO Module to wrap OpenWeatherAPI. 

To use it, you must set a Enviroment variable names "OWKEY" to your OpenWeather API key. Then you can freely call the functions.

Covered API calls:
- Get Current Weather using ZIP code
- Get Current Weather using Coordinates (longitude and latitude)
- Geocode using ZIP
- Geocode using city name

Stuff to do
1: Move over to One Call API
2: Refactor code to make it more "DRY"
3: Add better error handlings
